## Project Overview

I built a simple command-line to-do list manager as one of my first Python projects. It's basic but functional. You can add tasks, remove them, and save/load from a JSON file.

## What I Learned

- Working with lists and basic data structures
- Reading and writing JSON files
- Building a simple menu-driven interface
- Exception handling (try/except blocks)

## The Code

The app lets you:
- View all tasks
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted
- Remove tasks by number
- Save your list to a file
- Load a previously saved list

## What's Next

I might add features like:
- Task priorities
- Due dates
- Maybe a simple GUI?
