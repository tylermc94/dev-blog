## Hey, I'm Tyler!

I am a Level 2 Software Support Engineer with HPE supporting the Zerto product. I'm currently learning to code and building cool stuff along the way. This blog is where I plan to document my projects and experiments.

## What I'm Working On

- Learning Python fundamentals
- Building up my homelab with Unraid, Home Assistant, Unifi Networking, and more
- Building a Home Assistant Dashboard kiosk with a Raspberry Pi and a 7" touch screen.

## Future Project Goals

- Creating an AI workshop assistant using Claude
- Building a Pi Bramble to get more comfortable in Kubernetes

## Hardware

- **Galactica:** My gaming PC running a Ryzen 5 3600X, 16GB of Ripjaws V DDR4, and an RTX 3070Ti.
- **Tower:** Formerly "Tycho", a Dell Poweredge T410 that I got for dirt cheap off eBay. Running a Xeon  X5560 and 32GB of ECC RAM. A little outdated, but 100% capable of my current needs. Runs Unraid with Home Assistant, MQTT, Pi-hole, InfluxDB and a few other things. *Network map coming soon*
- **Network:** Ubiquiti Dream Machine with various Unifi devices
- **Ender 3:** My first and only 3D printer, I've had this for a few years and it has been rock solid. I swapped the motherboard and added a glass build plate and metal extruder, both other than that I havent done any crazy mods to it.

## My Favorite Things
Some things that are holding my attention at the moment.
- **Claude AI** Has been super useful in setting up this site and helping me learn Python. I use the projects feature to have a "Tech Projects" folder with a bunch of chats inside for different things I'm working on.
- **Factorio** With all the home automation stuff I've been working on in Home Assistant, the constant automation and optimization in this game is super satisfying. I can't stop playing.
